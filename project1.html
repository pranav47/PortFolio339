<h1>Spread Design</h1>

<p>This project was the third project in the IAT 233 (Spatial Design) course. The project required us to model an architectural space and explore art direction strategies and design two spreads which contained information on the space as well as it's designer.This project was supposed to be completed in teams of 5-6 students.</p>

<p>We were assigned St. Ignatius Chapel by Steven Holl. As a team we chose the parts we all were the most interested in.</p>

<p>Since me and Samyak were working on Copywriting, Research and graphic design together, we first started researching by finding some books and online resources on Steven Holl and St. Ignatius Chapel. We both started reading some resources and discussed our key findings and jotted them down on our shared google drives doc.</p>

<p>After researching and making notes from our resources. We started focusing on what type of content we wanted to showcase in our spreads. We then went over the breif again and noted key points which we could focus on.</p>
