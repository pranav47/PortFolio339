<h1> WHO IS THIS GUY?</h1>

<p> Hi, My name is Pranav Sharma and I am design student based in Vancouver. I enjoy design in all media's, but I am a big fan of visual and product design. A quote from the famous Industrial designer Dieter Rams “Less but better” really influenced me as a designer, and whenever I design I like to keep my designs functional and true to their purpose. I also enjoy developing websites, and I am currently looking for a role in which I can practice my design and web development skills. </p>
